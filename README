Usage: transmitter.py [options]
Options:
      --baudPower=  Serial baudrate for Power settings [default: 9600]
      --baudRDS=    Serial baudrate for RDS settings [default: 19200]
  -p, --port=       Serial port to use [default: /dev/ttyUSB0]
  -w, --webport=    Web port to use for embedded Web server [default: 8080]
  -s, --wsurl=      WebSocket port to use for embedded WebSocket server
                    [default: ws://localhost:9000]
      --version     Display Twisted version and exit.
      --help        Display this help and exit.


Example:

./transmitter.py -s ws://localhost:8081 -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --baudPower=9600 --baudRDS=19200


SSL Certificate for HTTTPS:
Create a directory named 'keys' and two files named 'server.crt' and 'server.key'
The following commands could be executaded:
  mkdir keys
  openssl genrsa 2048 > keys/server.key
  openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key server.key > keys/server.crt

Details:
The transmitter has the special tags @DATE and @TIME for the RDS PS option. 
The transmitter has support for rolling PS, but that is not implemented.


Baudrates:
The baudrates deserve explanation. 
The two baud rates are due to the way the transmitter is setup up.
From factory, both are setup to 14400 bps, which is Windows specific. 
The RDS module snoops in on the connection to the power module.
We asked the manufacturer to changed the baudrate, without realising that there were two baud rates. 
He changed the power rate to 9600, and the RDS module can not be configured for that option, but it can be for 19200.


Known Bugs:
 * Right Gain is mapped to Left Gain and Left Gain to Right Gain in transmitter
 * sending both right and left does not work for both, only one.
